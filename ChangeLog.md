## 1.1

=== TBD

 * Allow 64bit integers for size-based log rotation parameters.
 * Make `mtev.thread_self` work in lua_web as it does in lua_general.

### 1.1.0

 * Add new structure, `mtev_huge_hash`, which uses LMDB to provide a
   disk-backed hash table of arbitrary size. If a dependency on LMDB is
   undesirable, one may configure with `--disable-lmdb`.
 * Change SONAME to include just the major version, making future minor-version
   bumps easier.
